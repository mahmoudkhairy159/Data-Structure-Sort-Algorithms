# Data-Structure-Sort-Algorithms App :


## Overview
This application demonstrates the implementation of various sorting algorithms on data structures such as arrays. The sorting algorithms included in this application are:

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Shell Sort
- Merge Sort

Each algorithm is designed to sort an array of numbers in ascending order, but you can easily modify the implementation to sort in descending order if needed.

## Algorithms Included

### 1. Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort compares adjacent elements in the array and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm repeats this process for all elements until the array is sorted.

### 2. Selection Sort
Selection Sort divides the array into a sorted and unsorted part. It repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted part and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted part, expanding the sorted section by one.

### 3. Insertion Sort
Insertion Sort works similarly to sorting playing cards. It takes one element at a time and inserts it into its correct position in the already sorted section of the array.

### 4. Shell Sort
Shell Sort is an optimized version of Insertion Sort. It starts by comparing elements far apart from each other and reduces the gap between elements gradually, performing a final Insertion Sort when the gap becomes 1.

### 5. Merge Sort
Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively splits the array into smaller sub-arrays until each sub-array contains one element. It then merges the sub-arrays in sorted order to produce the final sorted array.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
You need to have a basic setup of any language (such as Python, JavaScript, PHP, or C++) depending on which language you are using for implementing the algorithms.

### Running the Application
